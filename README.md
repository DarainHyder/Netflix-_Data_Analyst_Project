Netflix Data Analyst Project
Welcome to the Netflix Data Analyst Project, where I explore a dataset of movies and TV shows to extract insights about genres, durations, release trends, and more. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets using Python, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and draw meaningful visualizations to guide data-driven decisions.

📁 Dataset
Name: mymoviedb.csv
Source: [Netflix Dataset – Kaggle or Simulated Data]
Description: Contains information on over 8000+ movies and TV shows including:
Title
Genre
Director
Cast
Country
Date Added
Release Year
Rating
Duration
Type (Movie or TV Show)

🧠 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset
Identify trends in Netflix's content addition
Analyze content by:
Type (Movie vs TV Show)
Genre/Category
Duration & Ratings
Country-wise production
Visualize key findings using matplotlib and seaborn

📈 Key Insights & Visualizations
Some of the questions explored:

What is the ratio of Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix?
What genres dominate the platform?
Which year saw the most releases?
Who are the most frequent directors and countries?
What is the average duration of content across types?

📊 Sample Visuals:
